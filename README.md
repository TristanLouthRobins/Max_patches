# Max MSP patches
## A repository of Max patches created for projects or simply as experiments.

### **Noise Wave (2011)** - version 2.0, 2011

A second attempt to emulate the sound of a crashing wave on a beach using Max/MSP - `noise~`  via `filtergraph` and function objects which determine frequency range/bandwidth and the level of gain over a 20 second duration.

### **Goyder's Line (2014-2017)** - version 5.0, 2017

The finalised Max patch that drives the realisation of this work.

### **Zona (2018)** - version 3.0, 2018

A complex sampler patch which was developed to create 'lowercase' sound textures and compositions. It was the primary compositional tool used for the creation of several compositions featured in my 2018 installation work, Compression and the album of the same name.

### **On Another Ocean (2019)** - version 1.0, 2019

A Max patch naively emulating the computer process of David Behrman's *On The Other Ocean* (1977). To be revisted and improved upon at some point.
